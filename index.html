<h2 >Alcohol Consumption Across The World <i class="fas fa-beer" style="color:sandybrown";width: 50%;    float: left;

<div id="plot" ></div>
<p style="width: 30%;float: right;"><br><br><br>The most basic definition of alcohol is an ingredient found in beer, wine and spirits that causes drunkenness.
  <br><br>According to the Global Health Observatory(GHO), the harmful use of alcohol results in the death of 3 million people annually. 
  230 different types of diseases stem from alcohol in some way or form. In 2018, worldwide total consumption was equal to 6.2 litres of pure alcohol per person 15 years and older. 
  <br><br>There are large geographical differences as seen in the map. Alcohol consumption across North Africa and the Middle East is particularly low â€” in many countries, close to zero. 
  At the upper end of the scale, alcohol intake across Europe is highest. Oceania and North America also display high levels of alcohol consumption.<br><br>
  The country with the highest alcohol consumption is Czech Republic with 665 Litres of alcohol per capita.<br><br>

<h2 >Correlation Between Alcohol Consumption And Suicide Rates Across The World <i class="fas fa-beer" style="color:sandybrown";width: 50%;float: right;></i></h2>

  Although alcohol may provide temporary relief from thoughts of suicide, in most cases it causes the issue to become worse. 
  Generally, mid-to-long-term alcohol abuse arises more frequent and more powerful thoughts of suicide, increasing the likelihood of suicide attempts. 
  Additionally, alcohol abuse causes other contributing factors to suicide to be worse. 
  For example, alcohol exacerbates the symptoms of many mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and depression, all of which contribute to suicide. 
  Alcoholism may also cause issues with employment, family relationships, interpersonal relationships, and with the legal system which may influence suicide.<br><br>
  People with alcoholism are also 120 times more likely to commit suicide than those without alcoholism. 29% of Americans who commited suicide were found to have alcohol in their system at the time of death.

<h2 >Correlation Between Happiness Score And Alcohol per capita And GDP per capita <i class="fas fa-beer" style="color:sandybrown";width: 50%;float: right;></i></h2>

<p style="width: 30%;float: right;" >
As per research, drinking alcohol is associated with greater happiness <b>in the moment</b>. However, it is unclear whether it is directly proportional with overall happiness of societies.
As seen in the graph, there is some evidence that happiness scores of a country scales with its alcohol consumption. A large proportion of countries with low happiness score and low alcohol consumption ranks low in GDP per capita,
this <b>may</b> suggest that residents in countries with low GDP's are unable to afford high alcohol consumption which in turn causes them to have low happiness score.<br><br>

<h2 >How Alcohol Consumption Affects The Income Of Society <i class="fas fa-beer" style="color:sandybrown";></i></h2>

As studies suggest, lower income was associated with higher alcohol consumption as a whole, not just heavy drinkers but light/moderate drinkers as well. Higher income is associated with more frequent
alcohol consumption, however this is usually in moderate amounts. This is usually due to individual upbringings (Higher income families may have traditions of drinking). This is shown in the graph 
which does not have a specific trend in income in proportion with alcohol consumption but there is a spike in income with low and high alcohol consumptions which backs up the studies conducted.
